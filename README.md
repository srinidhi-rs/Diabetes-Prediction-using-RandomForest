🩺 Diabetes Prediction Model 🧠


Predict diabetes using machine learning! This Python-based model leverages RandomForestClassifier from scikit-learn to predict diabetes with 96% accuracy based on health metrics.

🚀 Features

✅ Data Preprocessing – Handles categorical variables like gender and smoking history.

✅ Machine Learning – Uses RandomForestClassifier for robust predictions.

✅ High Accuracy – Achieves 96% accuracy on the test dataset.

✅ Interactive – Input health metrics and get instant predictions!

🛠️ How It Works

1️⃣ Load Dataset – Includes gender, age, BMI, HbA1c level, etc.

2️⃣ Preprocess Data – Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

3️⃣ Prepare Training Data – x (features) and y (diabetes status).

4️⃣ Train Model – Fit a RandomForestClassifier.

5️⃣ Evaluate Model – Test accuracy is 96%.

6️⃣ Make Predictions – Input health metrics to get a prediction.

🎉 Example Output

🔹 Negative Prediction: Diabetes Result: Negative 🎉

🔹 Positive Prediction: Diabetes Result: Positive (Consult a doctor) 🚨


🖥️ How to Use

1️⃣ Install Dependencies 

2️⃣ Run the Script 

3️⃣ Enter Your Health Metrics

🚀 Future Improvements

🔹 Deploy as a web app using Flask.

🔹 Experiment with XGBoost or neural networks.
